# Nitrous
Device content manager for the Stem Player written in C++ using Qt

Nitrous is a third party solution that makes managing the content on Stem Player devices significantly easier to do. Not only is it an offline tool that is significantly more streamlined for managing the content on the stem player, but it ensures that managing your stem player remains possible well into the future.

## About
In 2021 Kanye West collaborated with Kano Tech to release the Stem Player, a music player device that can play songs that have been separated into 4 separate stem tracks that are all individually toggleable. Stems are layers in a music track of instruments that are grouped together typically by the type of instrument or sound that it is. The only way to manage the content on the device is by plugging the stem player into your PC via USB and then going to a website in a Chrome based browser that let's you manage what is on the device, however the official management tool is generally regarded as clunky and limited in functionality.

## Features
- Edit album & track data
- Backup & Restore device
- Backup proddata
- Hot swap tracks from other drives

## Future Plans
If for some reason you're reading this project page this early in development, then I just wanna thank you for stopping by and I assure you I intend on writing proper technical documentation here as well as a feature overview to help guide users on how this tool is intended to be used. <3
